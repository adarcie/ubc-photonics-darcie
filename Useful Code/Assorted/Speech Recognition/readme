ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK
-this was a hastily assembled project and is organized as such

This is a project I was working on to create a customized personal assistant using Google's Speech to text API.

voice_commands_v2.py is the main function. It relies on a list of additional commands in commands.csv

It has many capabilities such as standard assistant commands:
-media controls
-calculator
-hotkeys

and more specific commands:
-paste a section of code that is used regularly (defined in csv)

I was playing around with the ability to add new commands by saying "when I say ____ do _____"
-this would save it as a properly-formatted command in the csv
-clearly this would be limited

It only listens when a designated hotkey is pressed.
