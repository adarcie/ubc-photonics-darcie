invert_custom.py and invert_custom2.py are used to invert a layout that has used the siepic-ebeam package.
-use boolean operations to bias the layout, then xor with the original to create trenches around waveguides
-customize the trench width, target and origin layers, and 2-layer vs 1-layer to fit process specifications


create_Si_clad.py takes an ebeam layout and adds a cladding layer compatible with the ebeam-ZEP package.
-essentially the first half of inversion
